A Study on Factors Influencing MBA Pursuit

We’ve been tasked with identifying factors that influence the decision of employees to pursue an MBA. In this study we work with 10,000 different participants spanning across 5 different job titles – Analysts, Consultants, Engineers, Entrepreneurs, and Managers. 
In order to analyze and test this dataset we’ve decided to break down our analysis by focusing on 3 main areas pertaining to each participant – their education, employment, as well as their age and gender. Our hypothesis is that we will be able to prove that …

Analysis 1 – Undergraduate Major vs Pursuing MBA

After first extracting only the participants that pursued an MBA, our next step was to identify the different undergraduate degrees and their impact on this study. The undergraduate degrees used in this dataset were very evenly distributed, allowing us to look at each without worrying about under or over representation. This was a positive sign that we wouldn’t have to worry about bias towards representation of one degree over others.
This dataset was comprised of the following degrees along with their representation of MBA pursuers: 
1)	Arts (19.2%)
2)	Business (19.0%)
3)	Economics (21.3%)
4)	Engineering (19.6%)
5)	Science (20.9%)

Our first analysis showed that each undergraduate degree had an almost equal number of MBA pursuers. Thus, we can conclude that undergraduate major was not a determining factor when identifying which group is more likely to pursue an MBA. This test was inconclusive.
